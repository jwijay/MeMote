How you'd build Polyn:
  - store a dictionary of words
    - a list of valid English words
    - is_valid_word(" ");

Trie:
  - data structure for string storage
  - re "trie" val
  - root, empty string
  - c node

node
  leaf: boolean
  children: [node]

////////////////////
Angular/Ionic:

  States

- today.q(1)
- today.q, controller
  - find out how many q.length

db.questions.insert({title: "What were your wins today?", order: 0});
db.questions.insert({title: "What did you learn?", order: 1});
db.questions.insert({title: "What is the most important thing you have to do tomorrow?", order: 2});
